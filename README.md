# SpringWithoutBoot

A small hands-on project to understand the core ideas behind the Spring Framework without using Spring Boot. The goal is to make the principles of dependency injection (DI), inversion of control (IoC), bean creation and lifecycle, and configuration visible and easy to explore — so you can see what Spring Boot automates for you.

## Why this project exists
Spring Boot is great for productivity, but it hides a lot of wiring and configuration. This project intentionally avoids that automation so you can:
- See how beans are created and wired.
